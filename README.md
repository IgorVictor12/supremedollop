This project was created in 2025 by the AllSpark team to document all the efforts and developments made for aerospace competitions at the academic level.

For 2025 (our first year as a team in a competition), we are focusing on developing a CubeSat from scratch for the 2025 INPE competition in São José dos Campos - SP, Brazil.

We are located at the IFMG - Campus Ibirité, MG, Brazil.
